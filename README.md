# GRID

**A terminal-first workspace for macOS.**<br>
A real terminal, a file browser, an app launcher, a widget deck and a web browser in one keyboard-driven window, styled after the production design of *Tron: Legacy* and *Tron: Ares*.

## Why GRID?

- **The terminal comes first.** Your real login shell in a native terminal ([SwiftTerm](https://github.com/migueldeicaza/SwiftTerm)) with tabs, splits and find. Everything else sits around it.
- **Everything is one keystroke away.** Files, apps, settings and web pages all open from the command palette (⇧⌘P), and every shortcut can be changed.
- **Native and lightweight.** Swift, SwiftUI and AppKit, with WebKit for the browser. No Electron, no background services.
- **Private by default.** No accounts, no telemetry, no cloud. Your data stays on your Mac ([details](#privacy--security)).

## Features

### Terminal
- Your login shell (zsh by default) with your usual PATH and dotfiles, in tabs and **split panes** (up to six per tab, any direction, draggable dividers).
- **Find** with case, regex and whole-word options; renamable tabs; busy, finished-job and bell indicators.
- **Drag files in safely:** dropped paths are inserted quoted and are **never run** for you.
- GRID tracks each session's working directory, so the Files panel and widgets can follow it.

### Files
- A file browser with breadcrumbs, history, an editable path, sorting, filtering and a deep recursive search.
- Folders **expand in place** as a tree (▸, or → / ←; ⌥ expands three levels).
- Or view a folder as an **icon grid** (▦ in the panel header): GRID-drawn folders and pages, with badges on well-known folders and the file extension on each page. The icons trace themselves in one after another when a folder opens.
- Everyday file operations: new folder, rename, duplicate, copy / paste / move, Move to Trash, multi-step undo, Quick Look and Open With.
![Files as an icon grid, with the Now Playing widget floating above it](docs/screenshots/files-grid.png)

- The **File Inspector** shows exactly what a file will insert into the terminal before you drag it, and warns about executables and downloaded files.

### A workspace you arrange

![The widget deck docked under the terminal with cards side by side, in the Ares theme](docs/screenshots/deck.png)

- **Dockable panels.** Drag Files, Terminal or the Widget Deck by its title bar to any edge of another panel. Terminal panes and tabs move the same way. The layout is saved.
- **Widget deck (⌘J).** Clock, System, Network, Storage, Power, Sessions, Pinned Apps, Git, Notes, Recent Files, the File Inspector and Now Playing, all showing real measurements. Drop a card beside another for side-by-side rows, which works well with the deck docked at the bottom.
- **Now Playing** shows what Apple Music or Spotify is playing, with play/pause and skip. The cover art is redrawn in your theme's colour as a dot matrix or scan lines, the track also shows in the status bar on every page, and you can **pop any built-in widget out** into a small window that floats above every page (and, if you like, above other apps).
- **Build your own widgets.** A widget is a folder with a `manifest.json` and some JavaScript. GRID draws it with its own components, so it always matches the design. Widgets run in a sandboxed helper process and can only use what you approve. See the [Widget API](docs/WIDGETS.md) and [nine examples](widgets/examples).

### Built-in browser

    <td align="center"><sub>Reader view (⇧⌘R)</sub></td>
  </tr>
</table>

- A full WebKit browser (Safari's engine) drawn in GRID's style: tabs, address bar with search, find, zoom and history.
- **New tab page** with a slowly turning dot-matrix globe (drawn on the GPU, paused whenever it isn't in view), your recent pages and a status readout.
- **Site themes** give GitHub, Hacker News, MDN, Wikipedia, Stack Overflow and Google Search GRID's colours and type. You can toggle them per site, and they follow your GRID theme.
- **Reader view** re-sets articles in GRID's monospaced layout.
- **Ad blocking** uses uBlock Origin's default filter lists through Safari's built-in content blocker, with a one-click "off for this site".
- **Extensions** in Chrome / Safari WebExtension format (macOS 15.4+) install after a permission review. Their buttons only appear once one is installed.
- Web pages can't reach your terminal, files or apps. Downloads always ask first.

### Map: ALPR cameras by region
- **A map drawn in GRID's own style** (⌥⌘5). GRID's GPU renderer draws:
  - glowing roads graded by class
  - a faint grid floor over dark land and water
  - wireframe buildings when you tilt it (⌥ + two-finger swipe up/down, or ⌥-drag)
  - a rotatable 3D globe when you zoom out far (drag to spin it), with solid land and oceans
  - **terrain:** shaded relief and contour lines with elevation labels, and real 3D mountains and
    valleys when you tilt (roads, buildings and cameras follow the ground)
  - labels in GRID's type, with street names running along their roads
  - **places:** shops, food, stops, sights, lodging and more as small glyphs, filtered by category

  It follows your theme and only draws when something changes.
- **Search places** (⌘F on the Map page): typing searches the place, street and shop names in the
  map already on your Mac, with no network. Press Return when nothing matches (or ⌘Return) to
  search OpenStreetMap online. Results show a pin and an inspector with the address, coordinates
  and links to Apple Maps and OpenStreetMap; clicking a place glyph does the same.
- **ALPR cameras mapped by OpenStreetMap volunteers** (via [DeFlock](https://deflock.org)):
  - **Choosing what to download:** a US state, a Canadian province, another country's region, or
    an area you draw. GRID keeps them on your Mac and shows them offline.
  - **Display:** each camera shows its facing direction as a wedge on the ground. Zoomed out, they
    gather into counted clusters. Click one for its vendor, operator and OpenStreetMap entry.
- **Directions that avoid mapped cameras**, worked out on your Mac: GRID downloads a region's
  OpenStreetMap road data once (asking first, with the size), builds its own road network from it,
  and routes offline. It shows the fastest route and one that avoids the mapped ALPR cameras it
  can, with distance, time, the cameras each passes and turn-by-turn steps. Right-click the map
  for Directions from / to Here, or use Directions in a place's card. **Print** a route (map and
  large-type turn list), save it as **GPX** for a GPS unit or offline navigator, or copy it as text.
- **Right-click the map** to inspect a camera, centre the map, copy coordinates, open the spot in
  Apple Maps or OpenStreetMap, or download the cameras in view.
  - **Each download asks first,** with the host, the number of requests and the size. Settings ›
    Updates shows how current each region is.
- **Locate** centres the map on you after asking. Your position stays in memory only.

### Command palette and themes

<img src="docs/screenshots/palette.png" alt="The command palette in the ENCOM amber theme" width="640" align="right">

**⇧⌘P** opens the palette for commands, apps, folders and web addresses. It understands a small grammar:

```text
app Safari
files ~/Projects
term ~/Projects
web example.com
theme ares
```

Palette commands are GRID commands. They are never sent to your shell.

Three themes: **Legacy** (cyan), **Ares** (red) and **ENCOM** (amber). Glow, motion and the grid backdrop can each be turned off, and GRID respects Reduce Motion.

The window opens with a short build-on (its frame traces itself in, then the panels build), and menus unfold from a bright line and fold back into it. Both take well under a second, never hold up typing, and can be turned off. Right-click and "⋯" menus are drawn in the same style, including web page menus and a terminal menu (Copy, Paste, Split…). You can switch back to standard macOS menus in **Settings › Effects**, and VoiceOver always gets standard menus.

## Install

1. Download **GRID-x.y.z-macOS.zip** from the [latest release](https://github.com/max-pasho/grid/releases/latest), unzip it and move **GRID.app** to Applications.
2. GRID isn't notarized by Apple yet, so macOS blocks the first launch. Open it once, then go to **System Settings › Privacy & Security** and click **Open Anyway**. You only need to do this once.
3. Optional: verify the download against the `.sha256` file from the same release:
   ```bash
   shasum -a 256 GRID-1.0.1-macOS.zip
   ```

**Updating.** GRID can check GitHub once a day for a new version (it asks first; change it in **Settings › Updates**, or use **GRID › Check for Updates…**). When one is out, **Download & Verify** saves the zip to Downloads, checks its SHA-256, unzips it and shows the new GRID.app in Finder. Quit GRID and replace the app in Applications. GRID never replaces itself.

### Requirements
- macOS 15 Sequoia or later (browser extensions need macOS 15.4)
- Apple silicon

### First run
- The first time a shell or the Files panel touches **Desktop, Documents, Downloads** or a removable or network volume, macOS asks for permission. That's the normal macOS privacy system, and GRID doesn't try to get around it. The command waits until you answer.
- Your shell starts as a login shell, so it behaves just like it does in Terminal.app.
- The **Now Playing** widget shows track changes without any permission. Its controls and artwork need macOS **Automation** permission for Music or Spotify; GRID asks only when you press Connect or a control, and never opens a player itself.

Every shortcut except ⌘1–⌘9 can be changed in **Settings › Keyboard**: click a shortcut and press the new keys. Shortcuts must include ⌘ (or be F1–F12) so they never take keys from programs running in the terminal.

## Build from source

You need Xcode 16.3 or later (GRID is developed with Xcode 27 and Swift 6.4). There are no other dependencies to install, because Swift Package Manager fetches them.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/max-pasho/grid.git
cd grid
scripts/bundle.sh        # release build -> build/GRID.app
open build/GRID.app
```

For development:

```bash
swift build              # compile
swift test               # run the unit tests
scripts/bundle.sh debug  # debug build of the .app
open Package.swift       # work in Xcode (run the "Grid" scheme)
```

Use the `.app` bundle for real use rather than `swift run`, since macOS privacy prompts, the Dock icon and LaunchServices all need a bundle identifier.

## Privacy & security

- **No accounts, telemetry, cloud services or AI features.** Settings, browsing data and history stay on your Mac. Terminal contents are never logged or stored.
- **Network requests GRID makes on its own:** downloading the ad-blocking filter lists from their publishers (only while ad blocking is on), Safari's standard fraudulent-site check in the browser, Spotify cover art from Spotify's image server (only with a Now Playing widget following Spotify), and **checking GitHub for a new GRID version once a day (only if you turned it on; no identifiers are sent)**. Everything else happens because you asked for it.
- **Maps are opt-in.** The Map page downloads nothing until you click **Enable Map Data**. After that:
  - **Map tiles** for the area you view come from OpenFreeMap, which learns roughly where you're
    looking.
  - **Elevation** for the area you view comes from the public AWS Terrain Tiles dataset
    (elevation-tiles-prod.s3.amazonaws.com) while the Terrain layer is on; Amazon learns roughly
    where you're looking.
  - **The region list** comes from Geofabrik, when you open it.
  - **Cameras** come from DeFlock's camera host for the regions you choose (US and Canada), or from
    an Overpass server elsewhere. That host learns which region you downloaded, and each download
    asks first.
  - **Online place search** happens only when you press Return or choose Search Online, never
    while you type. It asks first, then sends your search and the visible area to Nominatim
    (nominatim.openstreetmap.org, the OpenStreetMap Foundation), at most once a second. Answers
    stay in memory for up to a day; searches are never saved. Turn it off or pick another server
    in Settings › Map.
  - **Road data for directions** comes from Geofabrik (download.geofabrik.de) per region, only when
    you confirm it; Geofabrik learns which region you chose. Routes are worked out on your Mac:
    start points, destinations and routes are never sent anywhere.
  - **Your location** is read only when you click Locate, stays in memory, and is never stored or
    sent by GRID.
- **Web content is isolated.** Pages get no bridge into GRID, can't run commands, and can't open other apps without a click and a confirmation. Downloads are confirmed and quarantined like Safari's.
- **Widgets are sandboxed.** Custom widgets run in a separate, locked-down process and only get the permissions you approve. Those are shown in plain words, with the exact commands, paths and hosts.
- **macOS protections stay on.** GRID isn't App-Sandboxed (your shell needs to reach your files), so it ships outside the Mac App Store. It never tries to work around macOS privacy prompts.

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full security model.

## Known limitations

- Not notarized yet (see [Install](#install)).
- A terminal tab holds up to six panes.
- Directory tracking follows the shell process, not `ssh` sessions or subshells.
- Dragging several items into Finder carries only the first one (an AppKit / SwiftUI limitation). Drags into GRID's terminal carry them all.
- The Git widget runs `git status`. Like any prompt that shows git status, a malicious repository's config could run commands, so point it only at repositories you trust.
- Some ads that uBlock Origin removes with page scripts (for example on YouTube) can't be blocked by Safari's content blocker.
- App discovery scans the standard Applications folders, up to three levels deep.
- Map camera data is only as complete and current as OpenStreetMap's volunteers have made it. The map has no search, traffic or routing yet.
- Now Playing follows Apple Music and Spotify only. Audio in a browser or other apps can't be read: macOS 15.4 and later reserve the system-wide now-playing information for Apple's own apps.

## Development

```text
Sources/GridCore        Core logic (paths, shell quoting, layout, ad-block filters, widget packages); unit-tested
Sources/Grid            The app: SwiftUI + AppKit views, terminal, files, widgets, browser
Sources/GridWidgetHost  Sandboxed helper process that runs custom widgets
Tests/GridCoreTests     Unit tests (swift test)
widgets/examples        Example widget packages
scripts/                bundle.sh (build the .app), release.sh (publish a release)
```

Debug builds include automation hooks for UI testing. They're only active when launched with `--args --qa`. See [docs/TESTING.md](docs/TESTING.md).

### Releasing

1. Bump `CFBundleShortVersionString` in `Resources/Info.plist`.
2. Write `docs/releases/<version>.md`.
3. Commit, then run `scripts/release.sh <version>`.

The script runs the tests, builds into `dist/`, zips the app with a SHA-256 checksum, tags `v<version>` and publishes a GitHub Release with the notes.

To sign and notarize with your own Developer ID:

```bash
